# Reinforcement-Learning-Agent-Portfolio
*Note, these notebooks are for my (small and humble) start up, and as such are still in use today. As a result, I can't freely share the full IPYNBs as they constitute currently in use proprietary material. However for showcase purposes I will be adding some snippets (if they aren't already added)!*

## Basic Project Overview
Designed and developed an interactive RL curriculum for Heart of Academy including engineered custom game environments and interactive lesson notebooks for students to train agents using core RL algorithms (DQN, MCTS, Policy Gradients) and visualize the reinforcement learning process.
